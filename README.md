## **Quantica Projects Hub** 


This repository is a growing collection of mini projects constructed using Quantica.
Its aim is straightforward: display what can really be made with Quantica and support others to get started by imitation.

Every project is tiny, understandable, and beginner-friendly—structured to be altered, expanded, and learned from.

This is not a testing suite.
This is a launchpad.

##  **Aim of This Repository**

 - Assist novices in learning the Quantica language by studying actual
   programs
 - Demonstrate practical applications of the language, not just syntax

 - Offer motivation for creating new Quantica projects

 - Act as a community-friendly examples hub

**If you can read a project here, you can develop your own.**

---

##  **Executing the Projects**

Confirm that Quantica is installed and accessible in your environment.
```
quantica run calculator.qc
```
Each .qc file is a self-sufficient program.

 - One concept per project
 - High priority on transparency and ease
 - CLI-based for the utmost availability
 - No frameworks. No distractions. Just the language.

## **What’s Next**

**This hub will develop to encompass:**

 - Math and science tools
 - File-based utilities
 - Simulations
 - Creative ASCII applications
 - Beginner-level quantum examples
 - Projects will progressively be classified according to difficulty and
   field.
